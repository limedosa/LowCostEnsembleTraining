# Tech Context

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for the framework.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building and training the CNN model.
- **NumPy**: Utilized for numerical operations and data manipulation.
- **Matplotlib**: Provides visualization capabilities for data exploration and model performance.

## Development Setup
- Virtual environment (`venv`) for dependency management.
- CIFAR-10 dataset files stored locally for data loading and preprocessing.

## Technical Constraints
- Limited computational resources for training ensemble models.
- Need for efficient memory usage during training.

## Dependencies
- TensorFlow/Keras for deep learning operations.
- NumPy for data manipulation.
- Matplotlib for visualization.
- Scikit-learn for data splitting and preprocessing.
