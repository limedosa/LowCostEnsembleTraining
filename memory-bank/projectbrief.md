# Project Brief

## Project Title
Low-cost Ensemble Training Framework

## Description
This project aims to develop a low-cost ensemble framework for CIFAR-10, leveraging techniques such as pruning, BatchEnsemble, and distillation to reduce training time and memory usage.

## Goals
- Implement a framework that efficiently trains ensemble models for CIFAR-10.
- Reduce computational costs and memory usage during training.
- Utilize techniques like pruning, BatchEnsemble, and distillation to achieve these goals.

## Current Status
- Code for loading CIFAR-10 data and metadata is implemented.
- Functions for displaying images and random grids are available.
- A CNN model is partially implemented with training and evaluation steps.

## Next Steps
- Refine the CNN model architecture.
- Integrate pruning, BatchEnsemble, and distillation techniques.
- Optimize training processes for reduced computational costs.
- Document the framework and its usage.

## Challenges
- Balancing model accuracy with reduced computational costs.
- Ensuring compatibility with CIFAR-10 dataset formats.
- Implementing advanced techniques like BatchEnsemble and distillation effectively.

## Deliverables
- A fully functional low-cost ensemble training framework.
- Documentation for setup and usage.
- Performance benchmarks comparing computational costs and accuracy.
