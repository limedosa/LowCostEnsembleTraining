# System Patterns

## Architecture Overview
The Low-cost Ensemble Training Framework is structured to support efficient training of ensemble models for the CIFAR-10 dataset. The system is modular, with components for data loading, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

## Key Design Patterns
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Utilizes functions to load CIFAR-10 data and metadata.
   - Normalizes pixel values for efficient training.

2. **Visualization**
   - Provides functions to display individual images and random grids for data exploration.

3. **Model Training**
   - Implements a CNN model with layers for convolution, pooling, and dense connections.
   - Supports regularization techniques like dropout and L2 regularization.

4. **Advanced Techniques**
   - Plans to integrate pruning, BatchEnsemble, and distillation for reduced computational costs.

## Component Relationships
- **Data Loading**: Feeds preprocessed data into the model training pipeline.
- **Visualization**: Helps users understand the dataset and model performance.
- **Model Training**: Core component that utilizes data and advanced techniques for efficient training.

## Future Enhancements
- Modularize the framework for easier integration of new techniques.
- Optimize the training pipeline for scalability and performance.
- Add support for additional datasets and ensemble methods.
