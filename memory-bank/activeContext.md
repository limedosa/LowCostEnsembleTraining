# Active Context

## Current Focus
The project is focused on developing a low-cost ensemble training framework for CIFAR-10. The immediate tasks involve refining the CNN model and integrating techniques like pruning, BatchEnsemble, and distillation.

## Recent Changes
- Created foundational Memory Bank files to document the project's context and architecture.
- Reviewed existing code for data loading, visualization, and model training.

## Next Steps
1. Refine the CNN model architecture to improve performance and efficiency.
2. Implement pruning, BatchEnsemble, and distillation techniques.
3. Optimize the training pipeline for reduced computational costs.
4. Document the framework's usage and performance benchmarks.

## Active Decisions
- Use TensorFlow/Keras for model implementation.
- Focus on CIFAR-10 dataset for initial development.
- Prioritize techniques that reduce computational costs while maintaining accuracy.
