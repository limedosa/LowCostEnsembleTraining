# Progress

## What Works
- Data loading and preprocessing functions for CIFAR-10 are implemented and functional.
- Visualization tools for displaying images and random grids are available.
- A CNN model is partially implemented with training and evaluation steps.

## What's Left to Build
- Refine the CNN model architecture for better performance.
- Integrate advanced techniques like pruning, BatchEnsemble, and distillation.
- Optimize the training pipeline for reduced computational costs.
- Add comprehensive documentation for the framework.

## Current Status
The project is in the development phase, with foundational components in place. The focus is now on enhancing the model and integrating advanced techniques.

## Known Issues
- Balancing model accuracy with reduced computational costs.
- Ensuring compatibility with CIFAR-10 dataset formats.
- Implementing advanced techniques effectively.
